					<h3>About the band</h3> <br>
					<p>Zero Hour consists of five young men who work varying jobs
						across different professions from an auto mechanic to a sales
						representative. They found their friendship in the hardcore scene
						and decided to create the same content that brought them together.
						When they are not working their full time jobs, they collaborate
						on creating new music and would like a website that will allow
						them to exhibit their creative work while also allowing them more
						fan engagement.</p>
